# ArcHive

**Archive today. Verify forever.**

ArcHive is a free tool that lets you save any webpage and prove exactly what it showed at a certain time. Unlike other screenshot tools or web archives, ArcHive makes a permanent, verifiable record on the Hive blockchain.

**Live App**: [https://dhenz14.github.io/archive](https://dhenz14.github.io/archive)

## Why Does This Matter?

Web content disappears all the time. Tweets get deleted, articles change, and websites go offline. If you need to prove what someone said at a certain time, screenshots can be faked. ArcHive solves this by:

1. **Extracting the actual content** from any webpage
2. **Generating cryptographic fingerprints** (hashes) that uniquely identify the content
3. **Recording those fingerprints** on a public blockchain with a timestamp that cannot be altered

If the content changes, the hashes will be different. This clearly shows if something has been tampered with.

## Key Features

### Cryptographic Verification
- **9-hash verification system**: SHA-256, BLAKE2b, and MD5 hashes for content, title, and overall integrity
- Each hash is a unique "fingerprint." Even changing just one character will create a completely different hash.

### Blockchain Timestamping
- Posts archive records to the Hive blockchain (free)
- Creates a timestamp that cannot be changed and can be checked by anyone
- Works with Hive Keychain extension or mobile app

### Multi-Platform Support
- **Desktop**: One-click bookmarklet for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Safari
- **iOS Safari**: Bookmarklet method (tap from bookmarks menu)
- **Android**: Direct URL method (paste any URL into ArcHive)

### Smart Content Extraction
- Automatically pulls out the main article content and removes ads and navigation
- **Twitter/X support**: Extracts just the tweet content (with optional replies)
- Works with complex sites that have dynamic content

### Link Explorer
- Search for any URL to find existing blockchain archives
- Finds archives even if the URL has changed slightly

### Large Content Support
- If content is larger than 64KB, ArcHive automatically splits it into parts
- Posts continuation as threaded comments
- When viewing, ArcHive puts all parts back together seamlessly

### Privacy-First Design
- Everything happens on your device - all content extraction takes place in your own browser
- No server sees your content - ArcHive is made up of static files only
- Can be self-hosted on GitHub Pages, IPFS, or any static hosting

## Real-World Use Cases

### Journalism & Research
Archive a company's website before any updates. This gives you blockchain-verified proof of its original content.

*Example: Archive a company's "About Us" page, product claims, or pricing before they can be altered.*

### Legal Evidence
Defamatory statements online can be quickly archived, providing verifiable proof before deletion.

*Example: Archive a social media post, review, or comment with a timestamp that holds up as evidence.*

### Academic Citation
Online sources often change or disappear, so having a permanent record is essential for citations.

*Example: Archive the exact version of an article or dataset you referenced in your paper.*

### Social Media Accountability
Public figures may delete controversial posts.

*Example: Archive tweets, threads, or posts before they are removed. ArcHive's Twitter/X feature captures only the tweet content, making it easy to read.*

### Price & Terms Monitoring
Companies change their terms of service or pricing without notice.

*Example: Archive pricing pages, terms of service, or policy documents so you can track changes over time.*

### Historical Preservation
Websites shut down and content disappears.

*Example: Archive important pages from websites that might shut down before they disappear for good.*

### Personal Protection
You need proof of what someone promised you in writing online.

*Example: Archive chat conversations, emails viewed online, or online agreements.*

## How to Verify an Archive

Anyone can verify an ArcHive record:

1. **Find the archive** using Link Explorer (paste the original URL)
2. **View the blockchain record** on Ecency, PeakD, or any Hive block explorer
3. **Compare the hashes** - if the content matches, the SHA-256 hash will be the same
4. **Check the timestamp** - blockchain timestamps cannot be backdated or altered

If someone says the content was different, generate the hash of their version. It will not match the blockchain record.
